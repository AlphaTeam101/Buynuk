# Platini Store - Flutter E-commerce App üõçÔ∏è

A feature-rich, modern, and high-performance e-commerce mobile application built with Flutter. This project was developed as a deep dive into the Flutter framework, focusing on implementing a scalable, testable, and maintainable codebase using Clean Architecture and BLoC.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Showcase

This app isn't just a UI clone; it's a fully functional application wired up to a real-world (fake) API, built with a focus on performance, scalability, and a "wow" user experience.

### Core Features

* **üîí Secure Authentication:** Full Login/Register flow with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Access and refresh tokens are securely stored on the device using `flutter_secure_storage`.
* **‚ú® Stunning UI & Animations:**
    * **Custom Design System:** Built from scratch with reusable components, typography, colors, and `ThemeExtension` for a consistent look.
    * **Full Dark Mode Support:** A beautiful, animated dark mode toggle.
    * **Fluid Animations:** Extensive use of `flutter_animate` for staggered list animations, `Hero` animations for seamless page transitions, and `AnimatedSwitcher` for stateful UI changes.
* **‚ö° High-Performance & Caching:**
    * **Full API Integration:** Consumes the [Platzi Fake Store API](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/en).
    * **Local Caching:** Caches data (like products/categories) locally to reduce network calls, minimize loading times, and provide a snappy, near-offline experience.
    * **Complex UI Layouts:** Uses `CustomScrollView` and `Slivers` for high-performance, complex scrollable screens (like Home and Profile).
* **üîç Advanced Search & Filtering:**
    * **Debounced Search:** Efficiently handles user input in the search bar, waiting for the user to stop typing before sending an API request.
    * **Filtering:** A functional filter screen (UI) to narrow down product results.
* **üõí Full E-commerce Flow:**
    * Product catalog, categories, and details.
    * Fully state-managed cart.
    * A multi-step checkout process.
* **üí≥ Payment Gateway Simulation:**
    * UI and state logic for selecting and simulating payments via PayPal and Stripe (Credit Card).
* **üîî Push Notifications:**
    * Configured with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to simulate order confirmation notifications.
* **üöö Order History & Tracking:**
    * A complete screen for users to view their past orders and simulate tracking an order in progress.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Tech Stack

This project is built on a foundation of modern, scalable, and professional best practices.

* **Architecture:** **Clean Architecture**
    * **`Domain`:** Contains the core business logic, entities, and repository interfaces (contracts).
    * **`Data`:** Implements the repositories and manages data sources (remote API and local cache).
    * **`Presentation`:** Contains the UI (Screens/Widgets) and the State Management (BLoC).
* **State Management:** **BLoC (Bloc Library)**
    * Used to separate business logic from the UI, creating a testable and predictable state.
    * Utilizes `Events` to trigger logic, `States` to represent the UI, and `Blocs` to manage the transformation.
